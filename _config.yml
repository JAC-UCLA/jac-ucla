 We're UCLA's official anime club! Welcome to our site! (ﾉ´ヮ´)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

 We’re a club dedicated to facilitating both on and off-campus gatherings for the appreciation of Japanese anime and culture! We welcome all anime fans to join us at our club-hosted events and local conventions, to meet with others who share the same passion for art and entertainment.

 UCLA's Japanese Animation Club is part of a larger network of collegiate anime clubs in California called "Cal Animage". The Cal-Animage network initially started so that different schools could work together to exchange manga/fansubbed tapes, since they were somewhat difficult to find back then.

 The club's original name was "Cal-Animage Eta", which means we're the 7th Cal-Animage chapter. Cal-Animage Alpha is in UC Berkeley. Cal-Animage Eta was founded over 25 years ago, making JAC one the oldest clubs at UCLA!
