 We're UCLA's official anime club! Welcome to our site! (ﾉ´ヮ´)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

 We’re a club dedicated to facilitating both on and off-campus gatherings for the appreciation of Japanese anime and culture! We welcome all anime fans to join us at our club-hosted events and local conventions, to meet with others who share the same passion for art and entertainment.

 We hold weekly club meetings. Please join us for screenings, awesome events, raffles, karaoke, cosplay, and much, much more!

 UCLA's Japanese Animation Club is part of a larger network of collegiate anime clubs in California called "Cal Animage". The Cal-Animage network initially started so that different schools could work together to exchange manga/fansubbed tapes, since they were somewhat difficult to find back then.

 The club's original name was "Cal-Animage Eta", which means we're the 7th Cal-Animage chapter. Cal-Animage Alpha is in UC Berkeley. Cal-Animage Eta was founded over 25 years ago, making JAC one the oldest clubs at UCLA!
