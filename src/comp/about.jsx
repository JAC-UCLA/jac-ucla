                Hi and welcome to UCLA’s Japanese Animation club webpage!
                </p>
                <p>
                We’re a club dedicated to facilitating both on and off-campus gatherings
                for the appreciation of Japanese anime and culture!
                We welcome all anime fans to join us at our club-hosted events and local conventions,
                to meet with others who share the same passion for art and entertainment. 
                </p>
