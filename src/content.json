        "UCLA's Japanese Animation Club is part of a larger network of collegiate anime clubs in California called \"Cal Animage\". The Cal-Animage network initially started so that different schools could work together to exchange manga/fansubbed tapes, since they were somewhat difficult to find back then.",
        "The club's original name was \"Cal-Animage Eta\", which means we're the 7th Cal-Animage chapter. Cal-Animage Alpha is in UC Berkeley. Cal-Animage Eta was founded over 25 years ago, making JAC one the oldest clubs at UCLA!"
