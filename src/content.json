        "Hi, we're UCLA's one and only Japanese Animation Club! Since 1991, we've been dedeicated to the appreciation of Japanese anime and culture, and those who enjoy it.",
        "We have weekly club meetings, currently held on %d% %t% in %r%.",
        "UCLA's Japanese Animation club is part of a larger network of collegiate anime clubs in California called \"Cal Animage\". The Cal-Animage network initially started so that different schools could work together to exchange manga/fansubbed tapes, since they were so hard to come by back then.",
        "The club's original name is \"Cal-Animage Eta\", which means we're the 7th Cal-Animage club. Cal-Animage Alpha is in UC Berkeley. Cal-Animage Eta (us!) was founded over 25 years ago, making it one of the oldest clubs at UCLA!"
