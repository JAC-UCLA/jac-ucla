Hi friends,

#####Setup

To start up react app, from the root directory run the following commands:

> npm install

> npm start

#####Workflow

The Navbar, About Us, Join Us, and Footer sections are the most complete in the Invision mockup.
*Do not start coding the other components, such as Kirigami, as they might change significantly.

If you want to start working on a particular component, create a new branch named after the component.

If an asset you need is missing, PM me.
