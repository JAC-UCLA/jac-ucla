Hi friends,

Setup

To start up react app, from inside the client folder run

npm install OR yarn install (if you're into that)
npm start   OR yarn start

To start serving resources from the express backend, run the same commands in the the top level folder.

Workflow

The Navbar, About Us, Join Us, and Footer sections are the most complete in the Invision mockup.
*Do not start coding the other components, such as Kirigami, as they might change significantly.

If you want to start working on a particular component, create a new branch named after the component.

If an asset you need is missing, PM me.
