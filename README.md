## Instructions

Committing changes to the master branch of the GitHub repository should automatically rebuild the website.

To test locally, make sure you have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) installed, run `jekyll serve`, and navigate to `localhost:4000` in your web browser.

Basic site data can be found in `_config.yml`. About entries are written using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

## Workflow

If you want to start working on a particular component, create a new branch named after the component.

1. For new tasks, create branches off master with a relevant name e.g. "fix-admin-page-loading-wheel" is a branch that does what is sounds like

2. Merge latest version of master into your branch and resolve conflicts.

3. When finished make a pull request to master and ask someone to test, code review, and approve it.

4. Merge to master.
